TODO
====

This is just a rough list of things that need to be
implemented:

* ensure that there is no overlap in the layout
  physical or in screenspace (`rect1 & rect2 & rect3`)
* Map physical layout to source image
* Transform wallpaper for each output
* Save wallpaper as combined image and/or as one image 
  per output
* Read layout settings from file
* Import screen layout from RandR
* GUI frontend?
* Ability to set wallpaper directly?
